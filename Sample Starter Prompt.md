I’m going to upload an HTML file containing student reflections from my legal research class. Each student’s ID# is in an <h2> tag, and their reflections are structured under <h3> headings in chronological order. The reflection content is inside <div> elements following the <h3> tags. Each student has at most five reflections, but some may have fewer if they missed a submission.

Once I upload the file, I will ask you questions that will and I want you to analyze the reflections and help me identify trends in student learning, struggles, and feedback. Specifically, I need you to:
•	Locate and extract reflection content for specific students when requested.
•	Summarize key themes, including what students struggled with, what they found useful, and what surprised them.
•	Identify patterns across multiple reflections to track student progress.
•	Provide actionable teaching suggestions, focusing on easy-to-implement improvements.
•	Highlight specific research tools, concepts, or strategies that students mentioned (e.g., Westlaw, Lexis, Boolean searching, litigation analytics, legislative history research).

Use bullet points for clarity, and order insights by frequency and significance (e.g., ‘most common struggle,’ ‘some students found,’ etc.). Maintain a constructive and supportive tone while prioritizing insights that will have the biggest impact on improving student learning.

Before I start asking specific questions, check the file structure and contents and let me know if you have any questions about how to process the reflections.
